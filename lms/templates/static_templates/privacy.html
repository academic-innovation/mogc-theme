    <h2>I. Overview and Scope</h2>

    <p>The University of Michigan (“U-M,” “University”) recognizes and values the privacy of the university community members and its guests, and strives to be the leaders and best in the ways in which we manage your personal information. This value is reflected in Regent’s Bylaw Sec. 14.07. Privacy and Access to Information, which states in part:</p>

    <p>“In collecting, utilizing, and releasing information about individuals associated with the university, the university will strive to protect individual privacy, to use information only for the purpose for which it was collected, and to inform individuals of the personal information about them that is being collected, used, or released.”</p>

    <p>In principle, the University of Michigan strives to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Collect, store, and use the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary for its legitimate business purposes, and to comply with legal obligations.</li>
      <li>Take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we manage is accurate and up-to-date.</li>
      <li>Limit who has access to the personal information in our possession to only those who need it for a legitimate, specific purpose.</li>
      <li>Protect personal information through appropriate physical and technical security measures tailored to the sensitivity of the personal data we hold.</li>
      <li>Communicate with our students, faculty, employees, suppliers, partners, and others about how we use personal information in our day-to-day operations.</li>
      <li>Provide opportunities to control your personal information, as permitted by applicable United States and other laws.</li>
      <li>Integrate privacy in the design of our activities when that involves the use of personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The University of Michigan’s Center for Academic Innovation (“CAI,” “we,” “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy details the ways in which your personal data may be collected, secured, shared, and used when you interact with Sites, Software, and MOGC Courses, as defined below (collectively, “Services”).

    <h3>Cookies</h3>

    <p>When you view our Sites, including those that host MOGC Courses, we may store some information on your computer in the form of a cookie. Cookies allow us to tailor our website to better match your interests and preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience all features and content of our Sites.</p>

    <p><strong>Our Sites use the following types of cookies:</strong></p>

    <p><em>DoubleClick Cookies</em></p>

    <p>Purpose: DoubleClick, which is run by Google, uses cookies to improve advertising. The cookies collect information specific to your browsing activity and keep it linked to your unique cookie ID. See DoubleClick’s <a href="https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/2839090?hl=en">cookie policy</a>.</p>

    <p>Opt-out: You can opt out of Google’s ad personalization from Google Ads <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Settings</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Google Analytics Cookies</em></p>

    <p>Purpose: Google Analytics cookies count visits and traffic sources in order to measure and improve the performance of our website. See details about Google Analytics’ <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">usage of cookies on websites</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">privacy policy</a>.</p>

    <p>Opt-out: Find out more about managing <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/managing">cookies through your browser</a>.</p>

    <p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals, CAI does not process or respond to DNT signals.</p>

    <h2>III. Software</h2>

    <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>

    <p><em>User-Provided Information</em> – Wherever prior and separate registration is needed to use Software, we will collect and store the information you enter into our systems when you create an account on an applicable Software hosting site, which will generally be accessed via links provided through an organization’s Learning Management System (LMS). We will also collect and store information you provide when engaging with the Software or when contacting us for other purposes or through other methods, such as over email. Information you provide generally will include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>your name, email address, user name, password and other registration information;</li>
      <li>information you provide us when you contact us for help;</li>
      <li>depending on the Software, transaction-related information, such as when you create or submit an assignment, make a grade prediction, submit or receive feedback on an assignment, create an announcement, or otherwise use features in Software that rely on user input; and</li>
      <li>information you enter into our system when using Software, such as contact information and project management information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Automatically Collected Information</em> – In addition, the Software may collect certain information automatically, such as the type of device you use, the IP address of your device, your operating system, the type of Internet browsers you use, location data or sites used to access/leave each page, and information about the way you use the Software, including your digital interactions with the Software and the date, time, and length of your visits. This information may be collected through the use of cookies and web beacons and is automatically stored in log files each time you visit our Sites and log into the Software. Cookies administered by the Center for Academic Innovation are used to identify a user across page loads during a session and are therefore necessary for an integrated user experience. Some of this automatically-collected data may be linked to user-provided information.</p>

    <p><em>Information Provided by Others</em> – We may receive information collected by other organizations that are using Software. Additionally, certain Software (specifically: Gallery, Write and Revise, Write and Annotate, and Recommender) can be easily integrated with third-party learning management systems and platforms using the Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI) standard (collectively, “LTI Applications”). For LTI Applications, we may receive information collected by LMS providers through LTI-enabled transfers or from the organizations and LMS providers directly. For all Software, including LTI Applications, information provided by others may include all of the same categories listed in the <em>“User-Provided Information”</em> and <em>“Automatically Collected Information”</em> sections above. LTI-enabled transfers occur automatically when using the LTI Application through your LMS and include account information (username and/or email address connected to the account) linked to the LMS you are using to access the LTI Application. The automatic transfer of account information is necessary to provide a fully integrated and seamless user experience between the LMS and LTI Application.</p>

    <p>The User-Provided Information, Automatically Collected Information, and Information Provided by Others described above shall be collectively referred to as “Software Data.”</p>

    <h3>How Your Information Is Used</h3>

    <h3>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h3>

    <p>The Center for Academic Innovation administers cookies to identify a user across page loads during a session and provide an integrated user experience. These cookies may be blocked through settings in your browser, but doing so would affect the functioning of the Software.</p>

    <p>Additionally, we may use Google Analytics Cookies to count visits and traffic sources in order to measure and improve the performance of our Sites. See details about Google Analytics’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">usage of cookies on websites</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">privacy policy</a>.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account, your registration, and your use of our Software and MOGC Courses, such as messages relating to account management, customer service, systems maintenance, and updates to terms of service and privacy policies.
