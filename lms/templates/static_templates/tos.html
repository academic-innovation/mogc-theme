Please read these terms of service carefully before using PROGRAM or the PROGRAM Materials. These terms of service govern Your access to and use of PROGRAM and the PROGRAM Materials and create a binding agreement (“Terms,” “Agreement”) between You and MICHIGAN.</p>

      <p>IF YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PROGRAM MATERIALS, OR YOU THINK THAT YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PROGRAM MATERIALS WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD CONTACT PROGRAM (see section 14) BEFORE YOU ACCESS OR USE THE PROGRAM MATERIALS.

      <h2>4. Copyright</h2>

      <p>Unless otherwise specified, the creators of PROGRAM Materials own the copyright to their content. MICHIGAN respects copyright law and requires You to do the same. MICHIGAN expressly prohibits the use of PROGRAM for the illegal transmission of copyrighted material, and will, if notified by content owners (see Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice, below), disable copyrighted material from being transmitted via PROGRAM.</p>

      <p>Copyright considerations when using the PROGRAM to create or upload Your own content are detailed separately in Section 6, “User Content,” below.</p>
