You may use our Services only in compliance with these TOS and all applicable laws. Use by anyone under the age of 13 is prohibited. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these TOS, including the policies referenced in these TOS.</p>

        <p>This Agreement is made by and between the Regents of the University of Michigan ("Michigan," “we,” “us,” “our”), a constitutional corporation of the state of Michigan, and you, the user (“Licensee.” “you,” “your”).</p>


        <p>BACKGROUND</p>

        <ol>
        <li><p>The University of Michigan’s Center for Academic Innovation (“CAI”) has developed Services; and</p></li>

        <li><p>Licensee desires to obtain, and Michigan, consistent with its mission of education and research, desires to grant a license to use these Services subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>

        <ol type="I">
          <li>
            <p>LICENSE<p>

            <p>Michigan hereby grants to Licensee, subject to these TOS and policies referenced in these TOS (including the <a href="https://ai.umich.edu/academic-innovation-website-privacy-policy/">CAI’s Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Ucy-lT33FmkDDYdtxHEJ_nRytVLr_XGRVq2moAsPB4/edit">CAI’s Learner Engagement Policy</a>), a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Services. You may access and download content from our Services only for your personal, non-commercial use. You agree to never share access to your account or with any third party and you acknowledge that using our Services does not give you ownership of or any intellectual property rights in our Services, including content and materials featured in learning experiences.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>LIMITATION OF LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS</p>

            <ol type="A">
              <li><p>Licensee agrees to use the Services only for Licensee's sole and exclusive personal, educational, and non-commercial use, and shall not disclose, sell, license, or otherwise distribute the Services, in whole or in part, to any third party without the prior written consent of Michigan. Licensee may not use the Services as part of any revenue-generating activities.</p></li>

              <li><p>Licensee shall not use, print, copy, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, create derivative works of or publicly display the Services, in whole or in part, unless expressly authorized by this Agreement. Furthermore, Licensee shall not use the Services to harm, threaten, or harass another person, organization, or Michigan and/or to build similar websites or services.</p></li>

              <li><p>All user data collected through the Services is subject to <a href="https://ai.umich.edu/academic-innovation-website-privacy-policy/">CAI’s Privacy Policy</a>. Any data downloaded from the Services by the Licensee may be used by Licensee for personal and educational purposes only.</p></li>

              <li><p>No ownership rights of Michigan in the Services are conferred upon Licensee by this Agreement. Michigan retains all rights and interests in the Services and reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. Licensee agrees to secure and protect the Services in a manner consistent with the maintenance of Michigan's rights in the Services.</p></li>

              <li><p>Licensee’s use of Services, including registration in any courses, does not constitute or qualify the Licensee for enrollment as a student at the University of Michigan. Further, such use does not entitle the Licensee to use any resources offered by the University of Michigan for its students beyond what is included as Services in this TOS.</p></li>

              <li><p>Michigan reserves the right to cancel, interrupt, reschedule, or modify any Services, including individual courses and content and assignments featured therein at any time and for any reason.</p></li>

              <li><p>Unless otherwise stated, Michigan makes no representation regarding the academic or professional value of any completion certificates or other records available through MOGC. Likewise, such courses are not, unless otherwise stated, intended to satisfy prerequisites for licensure or lead to similar credentials for any profession in any state or in any country or region. Participation in or completion of courses made available through MOGC does not confer any academic credit, and Michigan has no obligation to the Licensee to seek recognition or an award of academic credit by any educational institution or accreditor.</p></li>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Michigan reserves the right to remove User Content without notice if it deems, in its sole discretion, that User Content is in violation of the terms of this Agreement. Licensee is solely responsible for saving, storing and otherwise maintaining copies of User Content to prevent loss.</p>
              </li>

              <li>

              </li>


              <li>
                <p>If Licensee provides Michigan with any suggestions, ideas, feedback, reports, error identifications or other similar information related to the Services (“Feedback”), Licensee hereby assigns to Michigan all right, title and interest in and to all Feedback, including all intellectual property rights therein, and shall assist Michigan in perfecting such rights and obtaining assignments of such rights from all individuals involved in generating the Feedback. In instances where Michigan uses Feedback to enhance the Services in any way, Licensee will not be considered an “Inventor” pursuant to the <a href="https://spg.umich.edu/policy/303.04">University of Michigan Technology Transfer Policy (SPG 303.04)</a>.</p>
